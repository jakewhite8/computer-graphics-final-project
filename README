For this project I have created a simple game which allows the user to aim and shoot an ice hockey puck at targets within a net.

- Aim horiztonally using the key's '1' (left) and '2' (right)
- Aim vertically using the key '3' (up) and '4' (down)
- Shoot the puck by pressing the 's' key
- reset the shooting scene by pressing 'r', which enables another shot to be taken
- press 0 to get a first hand view of the shot angle
